# hack-a-thing-2-foodtracker
## Sophia Jiang, Nicole Chen

## What we built
We built an IOS app following the tutorials here: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1

## What we learnt
We learnt how to build a simple IOS app  since neither of us has experience with that before.
We followed the tutorial and achieved everything required by this game.

## What didn't work
- At some point we encoutered the following with git. We resolved it by switching wifi. 
```fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/hack-a-thing-2-foodtracker.git/': Server aborted the SSL handshake```
